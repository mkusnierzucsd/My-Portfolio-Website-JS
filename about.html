                    <h3>All About Me</h3>
                    <p>
                        I'm a 4th-year student at UCSD studying Computer Science. I have worked on several projects covering
                        various aspects of software engineering, including both <strong>front and back-end development, AI/Machine 
                        Learning, embedded systems</strong>, and more.<br>
                        I first started programming with Java in high school. I quickly found that I enjoyed seeing what I made 
                        appear on the screen. I liked the creativity and diversity that programming enabled. I began expanding my 
                        skillset and learning other languages, and I eventually decided to pursue programming further in college.
                        <br>
                        Recently, I've been interested more in <strong>web development</strong>. I've learned that the design of a webpage has a big 
                        impact on the overall user experience, and can make or break a product. I've also been learning more about
                        machine learning. I think that AI will continue to play a bigger role in the business and professional 
                        world, and I'm interested in seeing how AI can positively affect the software field.
